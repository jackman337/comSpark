# Commitspark Example: Component-based Website

Follow these three steps to start using [Commitspark](https://commitspark.com), the workflow-first Content Management System based on Git and GraphQL:

1. [Copy this template](https://github.com/commitspark/example-content-website/generate)
2. [Sign in with GitHub to Commitspark](https://commitspark.com/en-us/sign-in/)
3. Select your repository copy and start editing

All content you create will be written to your repository on GitHub.

---

In this example, we have a content model ready to manage content for a website built from different content components.

It is meant as a starting-point for building your own content model by
[extending the schema file](schema/schema.graphql) using standard GraphQL types. (Visual model editing will be
available in the future.)
